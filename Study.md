# Zero-Knowledge Proofs 

## Introduction: 
Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are ways of proving that a statement is true without revealing any information about the statement. 

To understand ZKPs in more detail, letâ€™s take the classic Alice and Bob analogy:

Alice has solved a problem presented to her by Bob 

Alice  wants to prove to Bob that she has solved the problem without revealing any information about her solution

ZKPs allow Alice (The solver) to prove to Bob (The verifier) that she has solved the problem. 

ZKPs have three core properties:

Completeness: If the statement is true, an honest prover is able to convince an honest verifier
 
Soundness: If the statement is false, a dishonest prover is unable to convince an honest verifier

Zero-Knowledge: The statement can be proven to be true without revealing any information about it 


## Key Terminology 

Interactive vs Non-Interactive ZKPs:

Interactive ZKPs are where multiple rounds of communication occur between the prover and the verifier until the verifier is convinced, these are inefficient for consensus mechanisms as they make the verification process more difficult
 
Non-Interactive ZKPs are where only a single message is transmitted between the prover and the verifier. In this case, only one round of communication is required which will deliver all the necessary information to the verifier so that they may validate the proof independently, these include proofs like SNARKS or Starks 

Claim/Statement: An assertion that must be proven to be true

Private/Public Inputs: 
Private inputs are inputs to the system which are only known by the prover

Public inputs are inputs to the system that are known by both the prover and the verifier 

Constraint: A mathematical operation or condition that must be satisfied to validate part of a claim
 
Circuit: A set of mathematical relations (constraints)  that must all be satisfied to validate the claim 

Witness: The set of private inputs and mathematical operations that the prover uses to verify the constraints that make up the circuit 

Verifier: The entity that attempts to validate that the prover has satisfied the constraints of a circuit 

Prover: The entity that attempts to prove a claim/statement through a witness that satisfies the constraints outlined within a circuit





## ZKSnarks: Trusted Setup in Zero-Knowledge Proofs:
A trusted setup is when a secret is used to generate a piece of data that is required every time a ZK computation is completed. Once the data has been generated, the secret must be destroyed. The key terms required for understanding trusted setups are:

Toxic Waste: Random values generated during the formation of the secret that must be destroyed 

Structured Reference String (SRS): A structured piece of data that is used by both the prover and the verifier during the process of verifying a ZKP 

Multi-Party Computation: A secret is generated by multiple participants who contribute their own randomness to a parameter through a secret transformation. They must destroy their secret after they have completed their contribution. The secrecy of multi-party computation comes from the fact that only one honest contributor who destroys their secret is actually needed in order to enable the secret to never be reconstructed 

Powers of Tau: 
An example of a trusted setup used by many ZKSnark algorithms is the powers of Tau.  The powers of tau outline the process of generating elliptic curve points via multiplication of the generator point (G).  During A multi-party computation is used to generate each value of Tau  , this occurs via the process outlined below:
Participant 1 uses a secret to produce t1
Participant 2  produces  t2 in the same way 
All the way up until participant n produces  tn
   Altogether, a final   value is created that generates the elliptic curve co-ordinate  G   This process is repeated to create the next terms t^2, t^3 and so on. 






## Polynomial Commitment:
A polynomial commitment is when the powers of  tau are used to commit to a certain polynomial ax^n+bx^n-1+cx^n-2....  without revealing the coefficients of the polynomial. This means you can substitute x for the elliptic curve 
points mentioned before

## Universal vs Circuit Specific:
A universal trusted setup can be used for multiple circuits up to a specific complexity and size
A circuit-specific trusted setup is used for one specific circuit 

## Zero Knowledge Proof of Knowledge (ZKPoK) vs Zero Knowledge Proof of Computation (ZKPoC):

ZKPoKs are proof of a certain piece of knowledge e.g:
Assert (my_age > min_age) for a club 
Assert I know a value x such that x^2=9

ZKPoCs are proof of a correct computation that validates the fact that the prover has the correct inputs 

ZKPoCs are the most common types of ZKPs because by proving that the correct computations were completed, the verifier can assert that the prover has the correct inputs within their witness
